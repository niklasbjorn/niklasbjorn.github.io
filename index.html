							<h2>About SBW 2016</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop is a two day conference held annually in Sweden at alternating universities. The target audience of SBW is PhD-students in Sweden working within the diverse field of bioinformatics. At the event young researchers get to present their own projects to their peers, either as an oral presentation or in the form of a poster. Additionally, participants can attend practical workshops as well as presentations of high impact keynote speakers.</p>
							<p><strong>No registration fee for PhD students, postdocs and master's students.</strong></p>

                                <h3>Lynn Kamerlin</h3>
								<p>Associate Professor, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Uppsala University
								<br />
								<a href=https://kamerlinlab.com/  <p style="color: blue;">Kamerlin Lab</p> </a>
								<p>Lynn Kamerlin is an interesting speaker with a decorative international career; in just over ten years she has completed a PhD of theoretical organic chemistry in the UK, done postdoctoral research in Austria, worked in the lab of a Nobel Laureate in the US and become an associate professor at the Uppsala University of Sweden.
									Working in a highly interdisciplinary setting spanning from wet lab experiments through multiscale modeling to bioinformatics, her main focus is on using a range of computational techniques to understand the mechanistic basis for complex biological problems.</p>
								<p>In her talk Lynn will touch on some of her main interests; the understanding of protein enzyme catalytic selectivity and promiscuity through computational modeling, and its implications for the evolution of protein function.</p>

                                <h3>Richard Bonneau</h3>
								<p>Associate Professor of Biology, Computer Science; Faculty Director of Bioinformatics, New York University
								<br />
								<a href=http://bonneaulab.bio.nyu.edu/ <p style="color: blue;">Bonneau Lab</p> </a>
								<p>Talk title: <strong>New methods for learning large network models underlying immune-microbiome interactions</strong> </p>
								<p>In the presentation Richard will discuss their efforts to model diverse immune cell type’s interactions with their environment and with the microbiome. The first part of the talk will detail new efforts to learn large scale biophysically motivated network models of both rare and comment immune cell types. This inference results in both network models and estimates of regulatory factor activity in a host of conditions.  The second part of the talk will consider new methods for learning microbial interaction networks (from both environmental and human associated datasets) and recent efforts to both learn these networks and also use the networks to model connections to complex meta-data (such as host immune factors, genetics and metabolites) as well as new methods for making sense of microbiome time series. The talk will finish with some discussion of limitations and implications for experimental design (alas, most questions posed during the talk will go unanswered).</p>

                                <h3>Ron van Schaik</h3>
								<p>Professor of Pharmacogenetics, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
								<br />
								<!--	<a href= <p style="color: blue;">Schaik Lab</p> </a> -s->
								<p>Ron is Director of the International Reference Center for Pharmacogenetics and leads the Unit for Research & Development at the department of Clinical Chemistry. Many drugs that are currently available are of the type “one size fits all”, but they don't work the same way for everyone. Pharmacogenetics is the study of how genes affect a person’s response to drugs. Ron´s research focuses on clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics, with the main interest directed towards pharmaceuticals used against transplantation/immunosuppression, oncology, pain, psychiatry, HIV and anticoagulation. Pharmacogenetics is still in its infancy and currently the implementations are (unfortunately) quite limited. In the future, pharmacogenetics will allow for the development of tailored treatments against a wide range of health problems.</small></p>
